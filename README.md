# beeper-pager
A webpage that sends emergency message to the owner. It's like a pager, but for the web.

(Work in progress, code by v0.dev)
## How it works
The webpage uses a form to gather message and send it to the owner through [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh). The owner will receive the message on their phone or computer.

## Deployments
See https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying

pnpm install
pnpm build
```
